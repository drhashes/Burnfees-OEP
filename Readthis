After the London fork the open ethereum pool no longer works because it gets the block reward wrong.

It needs to subtract burning of fees from the total block reward. For someone not familiar with OEP and golang 
this can be an almost impossible task to fix.

I can sell consulting work to fix this for you on OEP. If interested you may contact me here on github.
